## 2024-05-24 - Frontend Table Render Layout Thrashing
**Learning:** The Caddy manager frontend UI relies entirely on vanilla JS and jQuery, meaning the standard framework abstractions (like React's virtual DOM) aren't present to protect against basic DOM thrashing and performance pitfalls in loops. `Array.find()` inside loops that manipulate the live DOM for each configuration row causes severe layout reflows and N^2 scaling problems as config size grows.
**Action:** When working in this codebase, assume manual optimization is required for rendering operations. Batch DOM manipulations into arrays and insert them all at once (e.g. `tbody.append(rows)`), and convert related collections into hash maps (O(1)) prior to iterating (instead of using O(N) array finds).
